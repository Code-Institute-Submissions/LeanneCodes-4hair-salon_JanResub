<p align=center>The 4Hair Salon Performance System</p>

This system allows user input and displays recommendations on what each salon should do to improve their average booking value from one system. This provides visibility on each salon’s performance and be able to make top-level decisions from an objective point-of-view.

## User Experience

User Story

There are now 6 salons under the 4Hair Salon franchise. One in London, Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and Nottingham. Each have their own Sales Manager monitoring the salon’s performance. 

A high-ranking employee with the title, National Director of Sales (NDoS) for 4Hair Salon, wants to have visibility on how each salon is performing and what they can do to improve performance. 

While the volume of sales is important, the NDoS wants to maximise the value each client brings to the salon. For example, if one client has a hair treatment that costs £20 and another that costs £50, the NDoS wants to maximise on each client spending £50 in the salon, thus increasing the booking/appointment value. 

One of 4Hair Salon’s business objectives is to maximise the average booking value (ABV) for each salon, by meeting the salon’s target every week. This will not only maintain sales at a healthy level but encourage the clientele to spend more.

Each salon has different targets, as the cost of rent and other overhead bills range in each city. Therefore, some salons will need to work harder to stay afloat and the NDoS will need some guidance on what actions each salon should take on to meet their target.
